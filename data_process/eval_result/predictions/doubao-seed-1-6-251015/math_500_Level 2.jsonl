Then \\( z^4 + z^2 +1 = (-1/2 -i\\sqrt{3}/2) + (-1/2 + i\\sqrt{3}/2) +1 = (-1) +1 = 0 \\). Oh, that works. Similarly, \\( z = e^{5\\pi i/3} \\): \\( z^2 = e^{10\\pi i/3} = e^{4\\pi i/3} \\), \\( z^4 = e^{20\\pi i/3} = e^{2\\pi i/3} \\), so same sum is zero.

First, let's make sure I understand the question correctly. We have two types of soldiers: upper class and lower class. The numbers are 5 upper class and 10 lower class. We need to choose 4 upper class and 8 lower class to form a battalion. The question is asking how many different battalions can be sent. \n\nWait, right, when we're choosing a certain number of items from a group without considering the order, that's a combination problem. Because the order in which we pick the soldiers doesn't matter—like, picking soldier A then B is the same as B then A for the battalion. \n\nSo first, let's handle the upper class soldiers. There are 5 upper class, and we need to choose 4. The number of ways to choose 4 out of 5 is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number, k is the number to choose. \n\nLet's calculate that first: C(5,4). Let's compute that: 5! / (4! * (5-4)!) = (5*4*3*2*1)/( (4*3*2*1)*1 ) = 5.

Let's compute C(10,8). Wait, C(n,k) = C(n, n-k), so C(10,8) = C(10,2). That's easier to calculate. C(10,2) = (10*9)/(2*1) = 45. Let me confirm: 10! / (8! * 2!) = (10*9*8!)/(8! * 2*1) = (90)/2 = 45.

First, let's list out the information given:\n\n1. Rosa's age divided by 2, 3, 4, or 6 leaves a remainder of 1. \n2. Her age divided by 7 leaves a remainder of 0 (so it's a multiple of 7).\n3. She's less than 75 years old.\n\nFirst, let's find numbers that when divided by 2,3,4,6 leave remainder 1. Let's call her age A. So A mod 2 =1, A mod3=1, A mod4=1, A mod6=1. That means A-1 is divisible by 2,3,4,6. So we need the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers first.\n\nLet's compute LCM of 2,3,4,6. Let's factor each: 2=2, 3=3,4=2²,6=2×3. The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present: 2²×3=12. So LCM is 12. Therefore, A-1 must be a multiple of 12, so A=12k +1 where k is an integer.\n\nNow, the second condition: A is a multiple of 7, so 12k +1 ≡0 mod7. Let's compute 12 mod7 is 5, so 5k +1 ≡0 mod7 →5k ≡-1 mod7 →-1 mod7 is 6, so 5k≡6 mod7. We need to find k such that this is true. Let's multiply both sides by the inverse of 5 mod7. What's the inverse of 5 mod7? 5×3=15≡1 mod7, so inverse is 3. So k≡6×3 mod7 →18 mod7 is 4 (since 7×2=14,18-14=4). So k=7m +4 for some integer m≥0.\n\nSo A=12*(7m +4)+1=84m +48 +1=84m +49. Now, A is less than 75. Let's try m=0: A=49, which is less than75. m=1: 84+49=133>75, so too big. So the only possible age is 49.

First, let's list out the information given:\n\n1. Rosa's age divided by 2, 3, 4, or 6 leaves a remainder of 1. \n2. Her age divided by 7 leaves a remainder of 0 (so it's a multiple of 7).\n3. She's less than 75 years old.\n\nFirst, let's find numbers that when divided by 2,3,4,6 leave remainder 1. Let's call her age A. So A mod 2 =1, A mod3=1, A mod4=1, A mod6=1. That means A-1 is divisible by 2,3,4,6. So we need the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers first.\n\nLet's compute LCM of 2,3,4,6. Let's factor each: 2=2, 3=3,4=2²,6=2×3. The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present: 2²×3=12. So LCM is 12. Therefore, A-1 must be a multiple of 12, so A=12k +1 where k is an integer.\n\nNow, the second condition: A is a multiple of 7, so 12k +1 ≡0 mod7. Let's compute 12 mod7 is 5, so 5k +1 ≡0 mod7 →5k ≡-1 mod7 →-1 mod7 is 6, so 5k≡6 mod7. We need to find k such that this is true. Let's multiply both sides by the inverse of 5 mod7. What's the inverse of 5 mod7? 5×3=15≡1 mod7, so inverse is 3. So k≡6×3 mod7 →18 mod7 is 4 (since 7×2=14,18-14=4). So k=7m +4 for some integer m≥0.\n\nSo A=12*(7m +4)+1=84m +48 +1=84m +49. Now, A is less than 75. Let's try m=0: A=49, which is less than75. m=1: 84+49=133>75, so too big. So the only possible age is 49. Let's check: 49 divided by 2 is 24 rem1, 49/3=16 rem1, 49/4=12 rem1, 49/6=8 rem1, and 49/7=7 rem0. Perfect, that fits all conditions.

The problem says we need to rotate the complex number 7 + 2i 90 degrees counter-clockwise around the origin. Hmm, how do rotations work with complex numbers? \n\nFirst, I remember that complex numbers can be represented as points in the complex plane, where the real part is the x-coordinate and the imaginary part is the y-coordinate. So 7 + 2i is the point (7, 2) in the plane. \n\nNow, a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation around the origin—what does that do to a point (x, y)? Let me recall the rotation matrix. For a rotation by θ degrees counter-clockwise, the matrix is [cosθ, -sinθ; sinθ, cosθ]. For θ = 90 degrees, cosθ is 0 and sinθ is 1. So applying that matrix to (x, y) would give (x*0 - y*1, x*1 + y*0) = (-y, x). Oh right, that's the rotation rule: (x, y) becomes (-y, x) when rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise around the origin.\n\nSo let's apply that to the point (7, 2). The x is 7, y is 2. So the new x should be -y = -2, and the new y should be x = 7. So the new point is (-2, 7), which as a complex number is -2 + 7i? Wait, wait, wait—wait, let me confirm again. Let's make sure I didn't mix up anything. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about complex numbers is multiplying by i. Because multiplying a complex number by i rotates it 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Let's check that. Let's take 7 + 2i and multiply by i: i*(7 + 2i) = 7i + 2i² = 7i + 2*(-1) = -2 + 7i. Oh right! That's the same result as the rotation matrix. So that makes sense. \n\nSo whether using the rotation matrix on the coordinates or multiplying the complex number by i, we get -2 + 7i.

The problem says we need to rotate the complex number 7 + 2i 90 degrees counter-clockwise around the origin. Hmm, how do rotations work with complex numbers? \n\nFirst, I remember that complex numbers can be represented as points in the complex plane, where the real part is the x-coordinate and the imaginary part is the y-coordinate. So 7 + 2i is the point (7, 2) in the plane. \n\nNow, a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation around the origin—what does that do to a point (x, y)? Let me recall the rotation matrix. For a rotation by θ degrees counter-clockwise, the matrix is [cosθ, -sinθ; sinθ, cosθ]. For θ = 90 degrees, cosθ is 0 and sinθ is 1. So applying that matrix to (x, y) would give (x*0 - y*1, x*1 + y*0) = (-y, x). Oh right, that's the rotation rule: (x, y) becomes (-y, x) when rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise around the origin.\n\nSo let's apply that to the point (7, 2). The x is 7, y is 2. So the new x should be -y = -2, and the new y should be x = 7. So the new point is (-2, 7), which as a complex number is -2 + 7i? Wait, wait, wait—wait, let me confirm again. Let's make sure I didn't mix up anything. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about complex numbers is multiplying by i. Because multiplying a complex number by i rotates it 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Let's check that. Let's take 7 + 2i and multiply by i: i*(7 + 2i) = 7i + 2i² = 7i + 2*(-1) = -2 + 7i. Oh right! That's the same result as the rotation matrix. So that makes sense. \n\nSo whether using the rotation matrix on the coordinates or multiplying the complex number by i, we get -2 + 7i. That should be the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. i*(a + bi) = ai + b i² = -b + ai, which is exactly the rotation (a, b) → (-b, a). Yep, that's correct.

Let's write that equation down: n² + 2n = 288. Then rearrange it to a quadratic equation: n² + 2n - 288 = 0. Now we need to solve this quadratic for n.\n\nLet's try factoring first. We need two numbers that multiply to -288 and add up to 2. Let's think... Let's see, 18*16 is 288. 18 - 16 = 2. Oh, right! So (n + 18)(n - 16) = 0? Wait, let's check: (n + 18)(n - 16) = n² -16n +18n - 288 = n² + 2n -288. Perfect, that's exactly the quadratic. So the solutions are n = -18 or n = 16. But since we need positive even integers, n can't be -18, so n is 16. Then the greater integer is n + 2 = 18. Let me confirm: 16*18 = 288. Yes, that's correct.

First, I need to remember that tan θ is sin θ / cos θ, so let's rewrite that first. \n\nSo tan 100° = sin 100° / cos 100°, so the expression becomes sin 100° / cos 100° + 4 sin 100°. Let's combine these terms over a common denominator: [sin 100° + 4 sin 100° cos 100°] / cos 100°. \n\nHmm, 4 sin θ cos θ is 2*(2 sin θ cos θ) = 2 sin 2θ, right? Because 2 sin θ cos θ = sin 2θ. So 4 sin 100° cos 100° = 2 sin 200°. Let's substitute that in: [sin 100° + 2 sin 200°] / cos 100°. \n\nNow, sin 200° is sin (180° + 20°) = -sin 20°, and sin 100° is sin (80°) because sin (180° - x) = sin x, so sin 100° = sin 80°. Let's rewrite those: sin 80° + 2*(-sin 20°) = sin 80° - 2 sin 20°. So the numerator becomes sin 80° - 2 sin 20°, denominator is cos 100°. \n\nWhat's cos 100°? Cos (180° - 80°) = -cos 80°, so denominator is -cos 80°. Let's compute the numerator: sin 80° - 2 sin 20°. Let's expand sin 80° as sin (60° + 20°) = sin 60° cos 20° + cos 60° sin 20° = (√3/2) cos 20° + (1/2) sin 20°. So substitute into numerator: (√3/2 cos 20° + 1/2 sin 20°) - 2 sin 20° = √3/2 cos 20° + 1/2 sin 20° - 2 sin 20° = √3/2 cos 20° - (3/2) sin 20° = √3 [ (1/2) cos 20° - (√3/2) sin 20° ]. \n\nNotice that (1/2) cos x - (√3/2) sin x = cos 60° cos x - sin 60° sin x = cos (60° + x) = cos 80°, because x is 20°, so 60+20=80. So that becomes √3 cos 80°. So numerator is √3 cos 80°, denominator is -cos 80°, so the whole expression is (√3 cos 80°) / (-cos 80°) = -√3? Wait, wait, let me check again. Wait, let's go back step by step to make sure I didn't mess up signs.\n\nOriginal expression: tan 100 + 4 sin 100 = sin100/cos100 + 4 sin100 = [sin100 + 4 sin100 cos100]/cos100. 4 sin100 cos100 is 2 sin200, correct. Sin200 = sin(180+20)= -sin20, so sin100 + 2 sin200 = sin100 - 2 sin20. Sin100 is sin(80), correct. So numerator sin80 - 2 sin20. Let's compute sin80 - 2 sin20: sin80 is 0.9848..., sin20≈0.3420, so 0.9848 - 2*0.3420≈0.9848 - 0.6840≈0.3008. Denominator cos100≈cos(100)≈-0.1736. So 0.3008 / (-0.1736)≈ -1.732, which is -√3.

First, I need to remember that tan θ is sin θ / cos θ, so let's rewrite that first. \n\nSo tan 100° = sin 100° / cos 100°, so the expression becomes sin 100° / cos 100° + 4 sin 100°. Let's combine these terms over a common denominator: [sin 100° + 4 sin 100° cos 100°] / cos 100°. \n\nHmm, 4 sin θ cos θ is 2*(2 sin θ cos θ) = 2 sin 2θ, right? Because 2 sin θ cos θ = sin 2θ. So 4 sin 100° cos 100° = 2 sin 200°. Let's substitute that in: [sin 100° + 2 sin 200°] / cos 100°. \n\nNow, sin 200° is sin (180° + 20°) = -sin 20°, and sin 100° is sin (80°) because sin (180° - x) = sin x, so sin 100° = sin 80°. Let's rewrite those: sin 80° + 2*(-sin 20°) = sin 80° - 2 sin 20°. So the numerator becomes sin 80° - 2 sin 20°, denominator is cos 100°. \n\nWhat's cos 100°? Cos (180° - 80°) = -cos 80°, so denominator is -cos 80°. Let's compute the numerator: sin 80° - 2 sin 20°. Let's expand sin 80° as sin (60° + 20°) = sin 60° cos 20° + cos 60° sin 20° = (√3/2) cos 20° + (1/2) sin 20°. So substitute into numerator: (√3/2 cos 20° + 1/2 sin 20°) - 2 sin 20° = √3/2 cos 20° + 1/2 sin 20° - 2 sin 20° = √3/2 cos 20° - (3/2) sin 20° = √3 [ (1/2) cos 20° - (√3/2) sin 20° ]. \n\nNotice that (1/2) cos x - (√3/2) sin x = cos 60° cos x - sin 60° sin x = cos (60° + x) = cos 80°, because x is 20°, so 60+20=80. So that becomes √3 cos 80°. So numerator is √3 cos 80°, denominator is -cos 80°, so the whole expression is (√3 cos 80°) / (-cos 80°) = -√3? Wait, wait, let me check again. Wait, let's go back step by step to make sure I didn't mess up signs.\n\nOriginal expression: tan 100 + 4 sin 100 = sin100/cos100 + 4 sin100 = [sin100 + 4 sin100 cos100]/cos100. 4 sin100 cos100 is 2 sin200, correct. Sin200 = sin(180+20)= -sin20, so sin100 + 2 sin200 = sin100 - 2 sin20. Sin100 is sin(80), correct. So numerator sin80 - 2 sin20. Let's compute sin80 - 2 sin20: sin80 is 0.9848..., sin20≈0.3420, so 0.9848 - 2*0.3420≈0.9848 - 0.6840≈0.3008. Denominator cos100≈cos(100)≈-0.1736. So 0.3008 / (-0.1736)≈ -1.732, which is -√3. Oh right! Because √3≈1.732, so that's -√3. So the final answer is -√3? Let me confirm again.\n\nYes, the numerator became √3 cos80, denominator is -cos80, so they cancel, leaving -√3.

Let me remember that formula: |a × b| = |a||b|sinθ, where θ is the angle between them. \n\nFirst, let's compute the magnitude of the cross product given. The cross product is (3,2,6), so its magnitude is sqrt(3² + 2² + 6²) = sqrt(9 + 4 + 36) = sqrt(49) = 7. Oh, that's nice, sqrt(49) is 7. \n\nThen, we know |a| is 2, |b| is 7, so plugging into the formula: 7 = 2*7*sinθ. Let's compute that: 2*7 is 14, so 7 = 14 sinθ → sinθ = 7/14 = 1/2. \n\nNow, sinθ = 1/2. What angles have sine equal to 1/2? Well, in the range between 0 and 180 degrees (since the angle between two vectors is always between 0 and 180), θ could be 30 degrees or 150 degrees. The question asks for the smallest possible angle, so that's 30 degrees. \n\nWait, let me confirm. The angle between two vectors is defined as the smallest angle you can rotate one to get the other, but actually, mathematically, the angle θ is in [0, π], so sinθ is non-negative there. So sinθ=1/2 gives θ=π/6 (30°) or 5π/6 (150°), so the smallest is 30°. That makes sense.

So now inside the next f: \\( f( g(f(-x)) ) = f( g(f(x)) ) \\) (because g(f(-x))=g(f(x))). Then the next g: \\( g( f(g(f(-x))) ) = g( f(g(f(x))) ) \\) (since the inside of g is same as at x). Then the next f: \\( f( g(...) ) \\) where the ... is same as at x, so that f is same as at x? Then the outermost f: same as at x? Wait wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's do it again step by step with substitutions:\n\nLet me denote each composition step with variables to track parity:\n\nLet’s define each function in the composition and its parity (odd O, even E):\n\nLet \\( F_1(x) = f(x) \\): O (odd)\n\n\\( F_2(x) = g(F_1(x)) \\): g is E, so E(O(x)) = E (since E takes any input, E(-y)=E(y), so E(O(x)) at -x is E(O(-x))=E(-O(x))=E(O(x)), so E)\n\n\\( F_3(x) = f(F_2(x)) \\): f is O, so O(E(x)): E(x) at -x is E(x), so O(E(-x))=O(E(x)), so O(E(x)) is even? Because O(E(-x))=O(E(x)), so F3 is E?\n\n\\( F_4(x) = g(F_3(x)) \\): g is E, so E(E(x))=E (since E(E(-x))=E(E(x))=E...)\n\n\\( F_5(x) = f(F_4(x)) \\): O(E(x))=E as before?\n\n\\( F_6(x) = f(F_5(x)) \\): O(E(x))=E? Wait no, wait F5 is E, so F6(x)=f(F5(x)), F6(-x)=f(F5(-x))=f(F5(x))=F6(x), so even?\n\nWait wait let's list all steps with parity:\n\n1. f(x): O\n\n2. g(f(x)): E(O) = E (because g even, so g(-a)=g(a), so g(f(-x))=g(-f(x))=g(f(x)))\n\n3. f(g(f(x))): O(E) = O(E(x)), since E(-x)=E(x), so f(E(-x))=f(E(x)), so this is E?\n\n4. g(f(g(f(x)))): E(E) = E (g even, so g of even function is even)\n\n5. f(g(f(g(f(x))))): O(E) = E again?\n\n6. f(...) where ... is E: O(E) = E?\n\nWait but wait, let's test with an example. Let f(x)=x (odd), g(x)=x² (even). Let's compute the composition:\n\nf(f(g(f(g(f(x)))))) = f(f(g(f(g(x))))) \n\nCompute step by step:\n\nf(x)=x; g(x)=x²;\n\ng(f(x))=g(x)=x²;\n\nf(g(f(x)))=f(x²)=x²;\n\ng(f(g(f(x))))=g(x²)=(x²)²=x⁴;\n\nf(g(f(g(f(x)))))=f(x⁴)=x⁴;\n\nf(...) = f(x⁴)=x⁴;\n\nSo the result is x⁴, which is even. So in this case it's even.\n\nAnother example: f(x)=-x (odd), g(x)=|x| (even). Let's compute:\n\nf(x)=-x; g(f(x))=g(-x)=| -x | = |x|; f(g(f(x)))=f(|x|)= -|x|; g(f(g(f(x))))=g(-|x|)= | -|x| | = |x|; f(g(...))=f(|x|)= -|x|; f(-|x|)= -(-|x|)= |x|. Which is even.\n\nYes, that's even. So the final function is even?\n\nWait let me confirm again with the parity chain:\n\nEach time we apply even function, it preserves parity (turns anything into even), odd function turns odd into even, even into even? Wait no: odd function applied to even input: if input is even (h(-x)=h(x)), then f(h(-x))=f(h(x)), so that's even.

The question says that \\( f(x) \\) is an odd function and \\( g(x) \\) is an even function. We need to determine if the composition \\( f(f(g(f(g(f(x)))))) \\) is even, odd, or neither. \n\nFirst, let's remember the definitions: \n\n- An odd function satisfies \\( f(-x) = -f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) in its domain.\n- An even function satisfies \\( g(-x) = g(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) in its domain.\n\nLet's denote the entire composition as \\( h(x) = f(f(g(f(g(f(x)))))) \\). We need to compute \\( h(-x) \\) and see if it equals \\( h(x) \\) (even), \\( -h(x) \\) (odd), or neither.\n\nLet's start from the innermost function and work our way out. Let's go step by step:\n\n1. Innermost: \\( f(x) \\). Since \\( f \\) is odd, \\( f(-x) = -f(x) \\). Let's call this \\( A(x) = f(x) \\), so \\( A(-x) = -A(x) \\) (odd).\n\n2. Next layer: \\( g(A(x)) = g(f(x)) \\). \\( g \\) is even, so \\( g(-y) = g(y) \\). Let \\( y = A(x) \\), then \\( g(A(-x)) = g(-A(x)) = g(A(x)) \\). So \\( B(x) = g(f(x)) \\), \\( B(-x) = B(x) \\) (even).\n\n3. Next layer: \\( f(B(x)) = f(g(f(x))) \\). \\( f \\) is odd, so \\( f(-y) = -f(y) \\). \\( B(-x) = B(x) \\), so \\( f(B(-x)) = f(B(x)) \\)? Wait no: \\( f(B(-x)) = f(B(x)) \\) because \\( B(-x)=B(x) \\). Let \\( C(x) = f(B(x)) \\), so \\( C(-x) = f(B(-x)) = f(B(x)) = C(x) \\)? Wait wait, let's do that again: \\( B(-x) = B(x) \\), so \\( f(B(-x)) = f(B(x)) \\), so \\( C(-x) = C(x) \\)? Is that right? Let's confirm: \\( B(x) \\) is even, so input to \\( f \\) is even function value. So \\( f \\) of even function value at -x is same as at x? Because \\( B(-x)=B(x) \\), so yes, \\( f(B(-x))=f(B(x)) \\), so \\( C(x) \\) is even here?\n\nWait let's take it step by step again carefully:\n\nLet me compute \\( h(-x) = f(f(g(f(g(f(-x)))))) \\). Let's substitute each step:\n\nFirst, \\( f(-x) = -f(x) \\), so replace the innermost \\( f(-x) \\) with \\( -f(x) \\):\n\n\\( h(-x) = f(f(g(f(g(-f(x)))))) \\).\n\nNext, \\( g(-f(x)) \\): since \\( g \\) is even, \\( g(-y) = g(y) \\), so \\( g(-f(x)) = g(f(x)) \\). So now:\n\n\\( h(-x) = f(f(g(f(g(f(x)))))) \\)? Wait no, wait next step: after \\( g(-f(x)) = g(f(x)) \\), then we have \\( f(g(f(x))) \\) inside the next \\( g \\)? Wait let's write the entire chain again:\n\nOriginal \\( h(x) = f( f( g( f( g( f(x) ) ) ) ) ) \\).\n\n\\( h(-x) = f( f( g( f( g( f(-x) ) ) ) ) \\).\n\nCompute \\( f(-x) = -f(x) \\), so inside the innermost \\( g \\): \\( g(f(-x)) = g(-f(x)) = g(f(x)) \\) (since g even). So now inside the next f: \\( f( g(f(-x)) ) = f( g(f(x)) ) \\) (because g(f(-x))=g(f(x))). Then the next g: \\( g( f(g(f(-x))) ) = g( f(g(f(x))) ) \\) (since the inside of g is same as at x). Then the next f: \\( f( g(...) ) \\) where the ... is same as at x, so that f is same as at x? Then the outermost f: same as at x? Wait wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's do it again step by step with substitutions:\n\nLet me denote each composition step with variables to track parity:\n\nLet’s define each function in the composition and its parity (odd O, even E):\n\nLet \\( F_1(x) = f(x) \\): O (odd)\n\n\\( F_2(x) = g(F_1(x)) \\): g is E, so E(O(x)) = E (since E takes any input, E(-y)=E(y), so E(O(x)) at -x is E(O(-x))=E(-O(x))=E(O(x)), so E)\n\n\\( F_3(x) = f(F_2(x)) \\): f is O, so O(E(x)): E(x) at -x is E(x), so O(E(-x))=O(E(x)), so O(E(x)) is even? Because O(E(-x))=O(E(x)), so F3 is E?\n\n\\( F_4(x) = g(F_3(x)) \\): g is E, so E(E(x))=E (since E(E(-x))=E(E(x))=E...)\n\n\\( F_5(x) = f(F_4(x)) \\): O(E(x))=E as before?\n\n\\( F_6(x) = f(F_5(x)) \\): O(E(x))=E? Wait no, wait F5 is E, so F6(x)=f(F5(x)), F6(-x)=f(F5(-x))=f(F5(x))=F6(x), so even?\n\nWait wait let's list all steps with parity:\n\n1. f(x): O\n\n2. g(f(x)): E(O) = E (because g even, so g(-a)=g(a), so g(f(-x))=g(-f(x))=g(f(x)))\n\n3. f(g(f(x))): O(E) = O(E(x)), since E(-x)=E(x), so f(E(-x))=f(E(x)), so this is E?\n\n4. g(f(g(f(x)))): E(E) = E (g even, so g of even function is even)\n\n5. f(g(f(g(f(x))))): O(E) = E again?\n\n6. f(...) where ... is E: O(E) = E?\n\nWait but wait, let's test with an example. Let f(x)=x (odd), g(x)=x² (even). Let's compute the composition:\n\nf(f(g(f(g(f(x)))))) = f(f(g(f(g(x))))) \n\nCompute step by step:\n\nf(x)=x; g(x)=x²;\n\ng(f(x))=g(x)=x²;\n\nf(g(f(x)))=f(x²)=x²;\n\ng(f(g(f(x))))=g(x²)=(x²)²=x⁴;\n\nf(g(f(g(f(x)))))=f(x⁴)=x⁴;\n\nf(...) = f(x⁴)=x⁴;\n\nSo the result is x⁴, which is even. So in this case it's even.\n\nAnother example: f(x)=-x (odd), g(x)=|x| (even). Let's compute:\n\nf(x)=-x; g(f(x))=g(-x)=| -x | = |x|; f(g(f(x)))=f(|x|)= -|x|; g(f(g(f(x))))=g(-|x|)= | -|x| | = |x|; f(g(...))=f(|x|)= -|x|; f(-|x|)= -(-|x|)= |x|. Which is even.\n\nYes, that's even. So the final function is even?\n\nWait let me confirm again with the parity chain:\n\nEach time we apply even function, it preserves parity (turns anything into even), odd function turns odd into even, even into even? Wait no: odd function applied to even input: if input is even (h(-x)=h(x)), then f(h(-x))=f(h(x)), so that's even. Odd function applied to odd input: f(h(-x))=f(-h(x))=-f(h(x)), so that's odd.\n\nSo let's track the parity of the input at each step:\n\nStart with x: input parity is variable (x is the input, so when we replace x with -x, the input becomes -x). Let's track how the value changes when x→-x:\n\nLet’s denote for each step, the value V when x→-x:\n\nStep 1: f(x) → f(-x) = -f(x) → V = -original value (sign flip: odd)\n\nStep 2: g(step1) → g(-original step1 value) = g(original step1 value) → V = original value (no flip: even)\n\nStep3: f(step2) → f(original step2 value) (since step2 value didn't flip) → V = original value (no flip: even)\n\nStep4: g(step3) → g(original step3 value) → V = original value (even)\n\nStep5: f(step4) → f(original step4 value) → V = original value (even)\n\nStep6: f(step5) → f(original step5 value) → V = original value (even)\n\nSo the final value when x→-x is the same as original value, so it's even.\n\nTherefore the answer is even.", "signature": null, "redacted": false}, {"internal": null, "type": "text", "text": "To determine if \\( h(x) = f(f(g(f(g(f(x)))))) \\) is even, odd, or neither, we use the definitions of odd (\\( f(-x)=-f(x) \\)) and even (\\( g(-x)=g(x) \\)) functions, working from the innermost layer outward:\n\n\n### Step 1: Innermost layer \\( f(x) \\)  \n\\( f(-x) = -f(x) \\) (odd, sign flips).\n\n\n### Step 2: \\( g(f(x)) \\)  \n\\( g \\) is even: \\( g(-y)=g(y) \\).

So maybe I can simplify each equation first to solve for x in terms of the base, then compare which base is the smallest because if the base is smaller, then x needs to be larger to get the same result, right? Let's check that.\n\nFirst, let's take any of the equations: 3*(base)^x =7. So dividing both sides by 3 gives (base)^x =7/3. Then to solve for x, we can take logarithms of both sides. Let's use natural logs or common logs, it doesn't matter because the log base will cancel out. So x = ln(7/3)/ln(base). Since ln(7/3) is a positive number (because 7/3 >1), then x is inversely proportional to ln(base), which means if the base is smaller, ln(base) is smaller (but still positive, since all bases are 1 plus something positive), so x will be larger. So our goal is to find which option has the smallest base, because that will give the largest x.\n\nNow let's list the bases of each option:\n\nA: 1 + r\n\nB: 1 + r/10\n\nC: 1 + 2r\n\nD: 1 + sqrt(r)\n\nE: 1 + 1/r\n\nWe know that 0 < r <3. Let's compare these bases. Let's pick a value of r to test, maybe r=1 first, since it's easy. Let's try r=1:\n\nA base: 1+1=2\n\nB base:1+1/10=1.1\n\nC base:1+2*1=3\n\nD base:1+sqrt(1)=2\n\nE base:1+1/1=2\n\nSo at r=1, the bases are 2,1.1,3,2,2. So B has the smallest base here, so x would be largest for B? Wait, but let's check another r to be sure, say r=0.25 (since sqrt(0.25)=0.5, easy). Let's take r=0.25:\n\nA base:1+0.25=1.25\n\nB base:1 + 0.25/10=1.025\n\nC base:1 + 2*0.25=1.5\n\nD base:1 + sqrt(0.25)=1.5\n\nE base:1 +1/0.25=5\n\nSo again, B's base is the smallest here. What if r approaches 0? Let's see r approaching 0:\n\nA base approaches 1 + 0=1\n\nB base approaches 1 +0=1\n\nC base approaches 1+0=1\n\nD base approaches 1+0=1\n\nE base approaches infinity. So let's see the difference between A and B when r is small, say r=0.1:\n\nA base:1.1, B base:1.01, so B is smaller. So B's base is always smaller than A's base because r/10 < r (since r>0). C's base is 1+2r which is bigger than A's base (1+r) because 2r>r. D's base: 1+sqrt(r). Let's compare sqrt(r) vs r. For 0 < r <1, sqrt(r) > r (since sqrt(0.25)=0.5>0.25), but for r>1, sqrt(r) < r (sqrt(2)≈1.414 <2). But even when sqrt(r) > r, like r=0.25, sqrt(r)=0.5>0.25, but B's base is 1 + 0.25/10=1.025 which is way smaller than D's base 1.5. So B's base is 1 + r/10, which is definitely smaller than all others except maybe... is there any case where B's base is not the smallest?\n\nE's base is 1 +1/r. Since r<3, 1/r>1/3≈0.333, so 1 +1/r>1.333, which is bigger than B's base (1 + r/10 <1 +3/10=1.3 when r<3). So E's base is bigger than B's.\n\nC's base is 1+2r, which for r>0 is bigger than 1 + r/10. So yes, B's base is the smallest among all options. Therefore, x for B is the largest. Let me confirm again with r=1: x for B is ln(7/3)/ln(1.1), which is larger than x for A: ln(7/3)/ln(2).

Let's try r=1:\n\nA base: 1+1=2\n\nB base:1+1/10=1.1\n\nC base:1+2*1=3\n\nD base:1+sqrt(1)=2\n\nE base:1+1/1=2\n\nSo at r=1, the bases are 2,1.1,3,2,2. So B has the smallest base here, so x would be largest for B? Wait, but let's check another r to be sure, say r=0.25 (since sqrt(0.25)=0.5, easy). Let's take r=0.25:\n\nA base:1+0.25=1.25\n\nB base:1 + 0.25/10=1.025\n\nC base:1 + 2*0.25=1.5\n\nD base:1 + sqrt(0.25)=1.5\n\nE base:1 +1/0.25=5\n\nSo again, B's base is the smallest here. What if r approaches 0? Let's see r approaching 0:\n\nA base approaches 1 + 0=1\n\nB base approaches 1 +0=1\n\nC base approaches 1+0=1\n\nD base approaches 1+0=1\n\nE base approaches infinity. So let's see the difference between A and B when r is small, say r=0.1:\n\nA base:1.1, B base:1.01, so B is smaller. So B's base is always smaller than A's base because r/10 < r (since r>0). C's base is 1+2r which is bigger than A's base (1+r) because 2r>r. D's base: 1+sqrt(r). Let's compare sqrt(r) vs r. For 0 < r <1, sqrt(r) > r (since sqrt(0.25)=0.5>0.25), but for r>1, sqrt(r) < r (sqrt(2)≈1.414 <2). But even when sqrt(r) > r, like r=0.25, sqrt(r)=0.5>0.25, but B's base is 1 + 0.25/10=1.025 which is way smaller than D's base 1.5. So B's base is 1 + r/10, which is definitely smaller than all others except maybe... is there any case where B's base is not the smallest?\n\nE's base is 1 +1/r. Since r<3, 1/r>1/3≈0.333, so 1 +1/r>1.333, which is bigger than B's base (1 + r/10 <1 +3/10=1.3 when r<3). So E's base is bigger than B's.\n\nC's base is 1+2r, which for r>0 is bigger than 1 + r/10. So yes, B's base is the smallest among all options. Therefore, x for B is the largest. Let me confirm again with r=1: x for B is ln(7/3)/ln(1.1), which is larger than x for A: ln(7/3)/ln(2). Since ln(1.1) is smaller than ln(2), so x_B >x_A. Correct. So the answer should be B.", "signature": null, "redacted": false}, {"internal": null, "type": "text", "text": "To solve the problem, we first simplify each equation to find the relationship between \\(x\\) and the base of the exponential term.\n\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the equations for \\(x\\)  \nAll equations are of the form \\(3(\\text{base})^x = 7\\).

Hmm, first, I remember that for a polynomial equation, the sum of the roots can be found using Vieta's formulas, but wait, the given equation has a 1/x term, which is a rational function, not a polynomial. So I need to convert it into a polynomial equation first by eliminating the denominator, right?\n\nLet me write down the equation again: 1/x + 5x² = 6x - 24. To eliminate the x in the denominator, I can multiply both sides by x, but I have to be careful that x ≠ 0 because division by zero is undefined. Let's do that:\n\nMultiply each term by x: (1/x)*x + 5x²*x = 6x*x - 24*x. That simplifies to 1 + 5x³ = 6x² - 24x. Then let's rearrange all terms to one side to get a standard polynomial equation. Let's bring everything to the left side: 5x³ - 6x² + 24x + 1 = 0? Wait, wait, let's check:\n\nOriginal after multiplying by x: 1 + 5x³ = 6x² - 24x. Subtract 6x² from both sides: 1 + 5x³ - 6x² = -24x.

Let's see: 5x³ = 6x² -24x -1, so 5x³ +1 = 6x² -24x, then divide both sides by x (x≠0) gives 5x² +1/x = 6x -24, which is the original equation: 1/x +5x²=6x -24. Perfect, that's correct.\n\nNow, for a cubic equation ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0, the sum of the roots is -b/a. So here, the cubic is 5x³ -6x² +24x +1=0, so a coefficient is 5, b coefficient is -6. So sum of roots is -(-6)/5 = 6/5? Wait, but wait, the problem says a, b, c are the roots. So sum a + b + c = 6/5? But wait, is that an integer?

Then 5x³ -6x² +24x +1=0. Yes, that's correct. So the cubic is 5x³ -6x² +24x +1=0. So sum of roots is (-coefficient of x²)/coefficient of x³ = 6/5. But 6/5 is 1.2, but the question says compute a+b+c.

The domain given is \\( 0^\\circ < x < 180^\\circ \\). What's the range of \\( \\sin x \\) here? Well, \\( \\sin 0^\\circ = 0 \\), \\( \\sin 90^\\circ = 1 \\), \\( \\sin 180^\\circ = 0 \\), and in between, \\( \\sin x \\) is positive. So for \\( 0^\\circ < x < 180^\\circ \\), \\( \\sin x \\) is in \\( (0, 1] \\). Right?

Let's see, if \\( \\sin x \\) is between 0 and 1, then the square root of that will also be between 0 and 1, since squaring numbers between 0 and 1 gives smaller numbers, so square root reverses that but still keeps it in the same interval. So \\( \\sqrt{\\sin x} \\in (0, 1] \\) as well? Wait, let's confirm: if \\( \\sin x = 0 \\), sqrt is 0, but \\( \\sin x \\) never actually reaches 0 in the domain (since x is strictly between 0 and 180), so sqrt(sin x) approaches 0 but is always positive, and when sin x is 1, sqrt is 1.

The problem is to evaluate the product of two sines: sin(A + B) * sin(A - B), where A is arcsin 0.5 and B is arcsin 0.4? Wait, let me check: the first term is sin(arcsin 0.4 + arcsin 0.5), which is sin(B + A), and the second term is sin(arcsin 0.5 - arcsin 0.4) = sin(A - B). So the product is sin(A + B) * sin(A - B). \n\nI remember there's a trigonometric identity for sin(X) * sin(Y). Let me recall... Oh right, sin(X)sin(Y) = [cos(X - Y) - cos(X + Y)]/2. Alternatively, maybe sin(A + B)sin(A - B) can be simplified directly. Let's expand both:\n\nsin(A + B) = sinA cosB + cosA sinB  \nsin(A - B) = sinA cosB - cosA sinB  \n\nMultiplying these two together gives (sinA cosB)^2 - (cosA sinB)^2. That's a difference of squares, so that's good. Let's compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, let's let A = arcsin 0.5, so sinA = 0.5. Then cosA = sqrt(1 - sin²A) = sqrt(1 - 0.25) = sqrt(0.75) = √3/2 ≈ 0.866..., but maybe we can keep it as sqrt(1 - 0.25) = sqrt(0.75) for now, but let's compute squares later.\n\nB = arcsin 0.4, so sinB = 0.4. Then cosB = sqrt(1 - sin²B) = sqrt(1 - 0.16) = sqrt(0.84).\n\nSo (sinA cosB)^2 = (0.5 * sqrt(0.84))² = 0.25 * 0.84 = 0.21.\n\n(cosA sinB)^2 = (sqrt(0.75) * 0.4)² = 0.75 * 0.16 = 0.12.\n\nSubtracting these: 0.21 - 0.12 = 0.09. Oh, that's nice! 0.09 is 9/100, which is 0.09. Let me confirm that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let's do it again: sinA = 0.5, so sinA squared is 0.25. cosB squared is 1 - 0.16 = 0.84. So sinA² cosB² = 0.25 * 0.84 = 0.21. Correct.\n\ncosA squared is 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. sinB squared is 0.16. So cosA² sinB² = 0.75 * 0.16 = 0.12. Correct. Then 0.21 - 0.12 = 0.09. That's 9/100, which is 0.09. So the answer is 0.09, which is 9/100, but let's check if that's right.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the product using the identity sin(X)sin(Y) = [cos(X-Y) - cos(X+Y)]/2. Let X = A+B, Y = A-B. Then X-Y = 2B, X+Y = 2A. So the product is [cos(2B) - cos(2A)]/2. Let's compute that:\n\ncos(2A) = 1 - 2 sin²A = 1 - 2*(0.25) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.\n\ncos(2B) = 1 - 2 sin²B = 1 - 2*(0.16) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n\nThen [0.68 - 0.5]/2 = 0.18/2 = 0.09. Oh, that's the same result! Perfect, so that confirms it. So the answer is 0.09, which is 9/100, but as a decimal or fraction? The problem says to put the final answer in a box. Let's see 0.09 is 9/100, but 0.09 is also acceptable? Let's check: 9/100 is 0.09, both are correct, but maybe the problem expects a fraction? Let's see 0.09 is 9/100, which is a nice fraction. Let me see: 0.21 - 0.12 = 0.09 = 9/100. Yes, that's exact. So the answer is 9/100 or 0.09. Let's write it as 9/100? Wait, but let's check if the problem allows decimals. The question uses 0.4 and 0.5, so decimal is okay, but 9/100 is a fraction. Let's see 0.09 is 9/100, which is 0.09. Either way, but let's see the calculation gives 0.09, which is 9/100. Let me confirm again:\n\ncos(2B) = 1 - 2*(0.4)^2 = 1 - 2*0.16 = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. cos(2A) = 1 - 2*(0.5)^2 = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5. Then (0.68 - 0.5)/2 = 0.18/2 = 0.09. Correct.

The problem is to evaluate the product of two sines: sin(A + B) * sin(A - B), where A is arcsin 0.5 and B is arcsin 0.4? Wait, let me check: the first term is sin(arcsin 0.4 + arcsin 0.5), which is sin(B + A), and the second term is sin(arcsin 0.5 - arcsin 0.4) = sin(A - B). So the product is sin(A + B) * sin(A - B). \n\nI remember there's a trigonometric identity for sin(X) * sin(Y). Let me recall... Oh right, sin(X)sin(Y) = [cos(X - Y) - cos(X + Y)]/2. Alternatively, maybe sin(A + B)sin(A - B) can be simplified directly. Let's expand both:\n\nsin(A + B) = sinA cosB + cosA sinB  \nsin(A - B) = sinA cosB - cosA sinB  \n\nMultiplying these two together gives (sinA cosB)^2 - (cosA sinB)^2. That's a difference of squares, so that's good. Let's compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, let's let A = arcsin 0.5, so sinA = 0.5. Then cosA = sqrt(1 - sin²A) = sqrt(1 - 0.25) = sqrt(0.75) = √3/2 ≈ 0.866..., but maybe we can keep it as sqrt(1 - 0.25) = sqrt(0.75) for now, but let's compute squares later.\n\nB = arcsin 0.4, so sinB = 0.4. Then cosB = sqrt(1 - sin²B) = sqrt(1 - 0.16) = sqrt(0.84).\n\nSo (sinA cosB)^2 = (0.5 * sqrt(0.84))² = 0.25 * 0.84 = 0.21.\n\n(cosA sinB)^2 = (sqrt(0.75) * 0.4)² = 0.75 * 0.16 = 0.12.\n\nSubtracting these: 0.21 - 0.12 = 0.09. Oh, that's nice! 0.09 is 9/100, which is 0.09. Let me confirm that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let's do it again: sinA = 0.5, so sinA squared is 0.25. cosB squared is 1 - 0.16 = 0.84. So sinA² cosB² = 0.25 * 0.84 = 0.21. Correct.\n\ncosA squared is 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. sinB squared is 0.16. So cosA² sinB² = 0.75 * 0.16 = 0.12. Correct. Then 0.21 - 0.12 = 0.09. That's 9/100, which is 0.09. So the answer is 0.09, which is 9/100, but let's check if that's right.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the product using the identity sin(X)sin(Y) = [cos(X-Y) - cos(X+Y)]/2. Let X = A+B, Y = A-B. Then X-Y = 2B, X+Y = 2A. So the product is [cos(2B) - cos(2A)]/2. Let's compute that:\n\ncos(2A) = 1 - 2 sin²A = 1 - 2*(0.25) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.\n\ncos(2B) = 1 - 2 sin²B = 1 - 2*(0.16) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n\nThen [0.68 - 0.5]/2 = 0.18/2 = 0.09. Oh, that's the same result! Perfect, so that confirms it. So the answer is 0.09, which is 9/100, but as a decimal or fraction? The problem says to put the final answer in a box. Let's see 0.09 is 9/100, but 0.09 is also acceptable? Let's check: 9/100 is 0.09, both are correct, but maybe the problem expects a fraction? Let's see 0.09 is 9/100, which is a nice fraction. Let me see: 0.21 - 0.12 = 0.09 = 9/100. Yes, that's exact. So the answer is 9/100 or 0.09. Let's write it as 9/100? Wait, but let's check if the problem allows decimals. The question uses 0.4 and 0.5, so decimal is okay, but 9/100 is a fraction. Let's see 0.09 is 9/100, which is 0.09. Either way, but let's see the calculation gives 0.09, which is 9/100. Let me confirm again:\n\ncos(2B) = 1 - 2*(0.4)^2 = 1 - 2*0.16 = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. cos(2A) = 1 - 2*(0.5)^2 = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5. Then (0.68 - 0.5)/2 = 0.18/2 = 0.09. Correct. So the answer is 0.09, which is 9/100. So the final answer is 9/100, but in boxed form, maybe 0.09 is also okay, but let's see 9/100 is 0.09, both are correct.
